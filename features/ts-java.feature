Feature: TypeScript generator for node-java

As a Node.js + TypeScript + node-java developer
I want to have TypeScript declaration (.d.ts) files java packages I use
so that I can use javascript with type safety comparable to java type safety.

  Scenario: Dummy
    Given nothing
    Then nothing happens
